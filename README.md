Open source web editor for Pandoc Markdown (and variants) to be used in conjunction
with Pandoc Server. Ripped from my previous attempt of an online, in browser
markdown editor, and also a new Bootstrap 4 admin template. Consequently all libraries
and code are in need of review and upgrade. Everything is WIP.

## Getting Started

To begin using this editor simply clone, cd into directory and run a simple web
server e.g. `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080`.
